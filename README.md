Alexa (Amazon Echo) connected to rest server turning on and off lights in hackerspace.

Poor quality code, few hours to show off at expo, but I put it anyway' cause I could not find simply explained file structure of what should be in a zip uploaded to AWS lamda. The name of main script is important ;)

Name of handler function inside is also important. It has to fit configuration section in AWS lambda.
